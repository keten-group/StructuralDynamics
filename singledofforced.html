<p>While investigation of free vibrations is a necessary starting point in discussions, critical performance issues are encountered almost always during forced vibrations while the system is acted upon by external load effects, either in the form of external forces or support motions such as those occurring during earthquakes. We’ll see that, while only the excitation amplitudes matter in static analyses, how the excitation varies with time and in relation to the time constants of the system matters as much, if not even more, in dynamic analyses. So let us begin by introducing some typical excitation patterns that are frequently encountered, hoping to lay the groundwork for the tools we will have to introduce for solution of various problems.</p>
<p>A static force is essentially a force of constant magnitude and direction. In principle, it is impossible to apply any load instantaneously, but when the duration it takes for the load to reach its peak value is much smaller in comparison with the period of the system, it may be feasible to model the load as what is called a step function, an example of which is sketched in <a href="#fig-sampleforcetime">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.1</span></a> (a). In this model the load is assumed to be applied instantaneously and it is relatively simple to handle analytically. The response of a damped SDOF system will eventually settle to the response one would obtain by static analysis, given by the ratio of the amplitude of applied force to the stiffness of the system. A larger peak response may however occur before this steady value is attained, which may be an important issue in certain applications.</p>
<div id="fig-sampleforcetime" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/sampleforcetime.png" class="quarto-discovered-preview-image img-fluid figure-img" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;3.1: Various types of forces frequently encountered in dynamic analysis. (a) constant (step), (b) impulsive, (c) harmonic, (d) periodic, (e) numerically defined, (f) random.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum is a force of very small duration relative to the period of the system, an example of which is sketched in <a href="#fig-sampleforcetime">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.1</span></a> (b). If the force duration is very small compared to the reaction time of the system, the effect is similar to imposing some initial velocity to the system. Such forces are called <em>impulsive</em>; as the force duration decreases to what one would call to be instantaneous, the force is mathematically modeled as an <em>impulse</em>. It is possible to obtain an analytical solution to the response of an SDOF system to an impulse and, moreover, this solution may be used to construct the response of a system to some arbitrary excitation.</p>
<p>Dynamic effects start to be more pronounced when one considers a harmonic excitation like the one shown in <a href="#fig-sampleforcetime">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.1</span></a> (c). When the duration of the force is long relative to the period of the system, the system will eventually start to oscillate with the frequency of the force during what is called the <em>steady-state response</em>. We will investigate this type of input in great detail since it will be shown that a very critical condition called <em>resonance</em> occurs when the frequency of excitation approaches that of the system. Resonance is critical because the maximum response of the system under resonance may reach multiple times of the static response it would show under the same amplitude of force, with the amplification factor being some function of damping. As this phenomenon is the cause of many failures in real life, understanding it is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>It may be that the force is not just a single harmonic wave but it comprises repetitions of some particular pattern as is the case shown in <a href="#fig-sampleforcetime">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.1</span></a> (d). When the duration of the force is long compared with the period of the system, such a repetitive force is called <em>periodic</em>. Under a periodic force the response will also eventually reach a repetitive cycle called the steady-state response; in that case the analysis may be conducted by modeling the periodic force as the superposition of a number of harmonics, and calculating the response as the superposition of the response to each harmonic, using the tools developed for the analysis under a single harmonic force. Periodic forces are important because the presence of multiple harmonics may lead to various risks regarding resonance.</p>
<p>Most often, however, we will have to deal with forces that are somewhat arbitrary in that their time variation can not be characterized analytically, as sketched in <a href="#fig-sampleforcetime">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.1</span></a> (e). In such cases, if the values of the excitation are known at points in time, the response may be evaluated via numerical techniques. We will introduce some numerical techniques that may be used in a wide variety of systems. Earthquake response calculations are generally based on such numerical methods since ground motions, which act as inputs to structures, are of such arbitrary nature, as numerous recordings of earthquake induced ground vibrations have shown.</p>
<p>In some cases it may not be possible to even measure the input. Some of such forces, an example of which is sketched in <a href="#fig-sampleforcetime">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.1</span></a> (f), may be modeled using tools and techniques from analysis of random processes, and the response of a system subject to such inputs is generally referred to as <em>random vibrations</em>. Random vibrations are generally analyzed in the <em>frequency domain</em> since random inputs are more easily characterized in that domain though their spectra. Although random vibrations are important in some applications, our focus in this chapter will be introducing basic analysis tools and understanding of forced vibrations.</p>

<p>To develop the general method for developing analytical solutions to forced vibrations, let us once again consider the prototypical SDOF model, shown for ease of reference again in <a href="#fig-sdofmckfbdrepeat">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.2</span></a>. The equation of motion for the system, obtained by summing the forces shown in the free body diagram and considering initial conditions, is given by <span id="eq-eomdsdofgen"><span class="math display">\[
m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct = \extforce(t) \, ; \quad \left\{\gc(0) = \gcic, \dgc(0) = \dgcic\right\}
\qquad(3.1)\]</span></span></p>

<p>Studies in differential equations tell us that the solution to <a href="#eq-eomdsdofgen">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.1</span></a> may be constructed via two components as <span class="math display">\[
\gct = \gc_{c} (t) + \gc_{p}(t)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gc_{c}(t)\)</span> is referred to as the complementary solution, given by the solution to the homogeneous equation so that <span class="math display">\[
m \ddgc_{c}(t) + c \dgc_{c}(t) + k \gc_{c}(t) = 0
\]</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gc_{p}(t)\)</span> is referred to as the particular solution satisfying <span class="math display">\[
m \ddgc_{p}(t) + c \dgc_{p}(t) + k \gc_{p}(t) = \extforce (t)
\]</span> The particular solution will depend on the forcing function and so it must be determined anew for each different type of force, whereas the complementary solution for an <em>underdamped system</em> will always be given by some form of <span id="eq-compsol"><span class="math display">\[
\gct = \expon{-\damp \freq t}\left(C_1 \cos \dfreq t  + C_2 \sin \dfreq t \right)
\qquad(3.2)\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span> are two coefficients to be determined. The existence of these two coefficients is what allows us to solve the problem since that freedom is needed to incorporate the contribution of initial conditions, something that the particular solution alone cannot do. That the superposition of the complementary and the particular solutions still satisfy the force equilibrium equation is trivial due to the linearity of the differential equation since <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
m \left[\ddgc_{c} + \ddgc_{p}\right] &amp; + c \left[\dgc_{c} + \dgc_{p} \right] + k \left[\gc_{c} + \gc_{p} \right]  \\
&amp; = \left[m \ddgc_{c} + c \dgc_{c} + k \gc_{c} \right] + \left[m \ddgc_{p} + c \dgc_{p} + k \gc_{p} \right] \\
&amp; = [0] + \left[m \ddgc_{p} + c \dgc_{p} + k \gc_{p} \right] = \extforce(t)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The linearity of the governing equation has even more significant consequences which has proven extremely useful in analysis: since <em>superposition</em> holds, the simultaneous action of a number of disturbances may be analyzed by evaluating the response of the system to each individual disturbance separately, and then superpose all the solutions thus obtained to evaluate the cumulative response; the principle is schematically explained in <a href="#fig-superposition">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.3</span></a>. To express this statement symbolically, if <span class="math inline">\(\gc^{(1)}\)</span> is the response of the system to some input <span class="math inline">\(\text{inp}^{(1)}\)</span> and if <span class="math inline">\(\gc^{(2)}\)</span> is its response to some input <span class="math inline">\(\text{inp}^{(2)}\)</span>, then the response of the system will be given by <span class="math inline">\(\gc^{(1)} + \gc^{(1)}\)</span> when the system is acted upon by both inputs simultaneously, i.e.&nbsp;by <span class="math inline">\(\text{inp}^{(1)} + \text{inp}^{(2)}\)</span>. If the inputs are amplified so that the system is acted upon by <span class="math inline">\(a_1 \text{inp}^{(1)} + a_2 \text{inp}^{(2)}\)</span>, then the responses to individual inputs will likewise be amplified so that the system response will be given by <span class="math inline">\(a_1 \gc^{(1)} + a_2 \gc^{(1)}\)</span>. Note that we have used the more generic term <em>input</em> to denote the effect that sets the system in motion for it can refer to a set of initial conditions and/or external forces and/or base motion; all of these may be investigated separately and the results thus obtained may then be combined to calculate the response that would occur under the combined action of all. We may therefore finally state the following: Let <span class="math inline">\(\gc^{(1)}\)</span> be the solution to the initial condition problem <span id="eq-eomdsdofgenic"><span class="math display">\[
m \ddgc^{(1)} (t) + c \dgc^{(1)} (t) + k \gc^{(1)} (t) = 0 \, ; \quad \left\{\gc^{(1)}(0) = \gcic, \dgc^{(1)} (0) = \dgcic \right\}
\qquad(3.3)\]</span></span> so that it is given for a viscously underdamped system by <span class="math display">\[
\gc^{(1)}(t) = \expon{-\damp \freq t}\left(\gcic \cos \dfreq t  + \frac{\dgcic + \damp \freq \gcic}{\dfreq} \sin \dfreq t \right)
\]</span></p>

<p>as we had shown while discussing free vibrations. If the same system were subjected only to some external force with zero initial conditions, the response <span class="math inline">\(\gc^{(2)}(t)\)</span> would have to satisfy<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span id="eq-eomdsdofgenzero"><span class="math display">\[

\qquad(3.4)\]</span></span> When the system is subjected to both the external excitation <span class="math inline">\(\extforce(t)\)</span> and the nonzero initial conditions <span class="math inline">\(\gc(0) = \gcic, \dgc(0) = \dgcic\)</span>, the response <span class="math inline">\(\gct\)</span> would have to satisfy <span id="eq-eomdsdofgen2"><span class="math display">\[
m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct = \extforce(t) \, ; \quad \left\{\gc(0) = \gcic, \dgc(0) = \dgcic\right\}
\qquad(3.5)\]</span></span> and the linearity of the system allows superposition so that <span class="math inline">\(\gct\)</span> is simply given by <span id="eq-soldsdofgen"><span class="math display">\[
\gc (t) = \gc^{(2)} (t) + \gc^{(2)} (t)  = \expon{-\damp \freq t}\left(\gcic \cos \dfreq t  + \frac{\dgcic + \damp \freq \gcic}{\dfreq} \sin \dfreq t \right)  + \gc^{(2)} (t)
\qquad(3.6)\]</span></span> This result will allow us to investigate all forced vibration problems with zero initial conditions as the additional contribution of any nonzero initial condition may simply be superposed afterwards.</p>
<!-- [^1]: That the initial conditions are zero DOES NOT mean the complementary solution has to be zero; $\gc_2$ will still need a particular and a complementary component. -->

<p>How the system responds to the force and the effects of damping on the response may be most easily visualized via the plots sketched in <a href="#fig-responsestep">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.5</span></a>. There are a few important things to be noted. First of all, in the presence of damping, the response eventually converges to the static displacement; how fast this convergence occurs depends on the amount of damping with faster rates occurring for larger damping values. Results obtained via static analyses are therefore the asymptotic values the dynamic responses eventually settle to whenever the duration of the load application is long enough. Another point worth making is that the maximum response that occurs may exceed the static response and the peak value depends again on the amount of damping. In fact, the velocity as a function of the normalized time <span class="math inline">\(\tau = t/\dperiod\)</span> may be shown to be given by <span id="eq-xsolstepvel"><span class="math display">\[
\dgc (t) = \frac{\sforce}{k}  \expon{- \damp \freq t}\frac{\freq}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \sin \dfreq t

<p>The complementary solution is still given by <a href="#eq-compsolstep">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.8</span></a>.

<p>Having determined the solution for a unit rate, we may easily extend this solution to the case when the rate of increase of the force is not unity but some <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> so that the force is defined as <span class="math display">\[

</div>
<p>A graphical comparison of the variation of response with damping in this case is not as straightforward as it was in the response to a step function. To help discuss general trends, <a href="#fig-responseramp">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.7</span></a> presents the responses that would be observed for a particular system for various values of the damping ratio. The normalized time used in these plots is <span class="math inline">\(\tau = t / \period\)</span> which differs from that used for previous investigations in that here we use the undamped period as opposed to the damped one. To help facilitate a visual reference, the plots also include what may be referred to as instantaneous static response <span class="math inline">\(\extforce (\tau) / k\)</span>. The tendency of the response is to converge to some percentage of the instantaneous static response. Since <span class="math inline">\(\freq t = 2 \pi \tau\)</span>, for an undamped system we have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\extforce(\tau)}{k} - \gc (\tau) = \frac{\lambda}{\freq k} 2 \pi \tau - \frac{\lambda}{\freq k} \left[ 2 \pi \tau - \sin 2 \pi \tau \right] = \frac{\lambda}{\freq k}\sin 2 \pi \tau
\]</span> so that the response oscillates around the instantaneous static response. On the other hand, whenever there is damping in the system we have, from <a href="#eq-solforceramp">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.18</span></a>, <span class="math display">\[
\underset{\tau \rightarrow \infty}{\lim}\left[\frac{\extforce(\tau)}{k} - \gc (\tau)\right] = \frac{\lambda}{\freq k} 2 \pi \tau - \frac{\lambda}{\freq k} \left[ 2 \pi \tau - 2 \damp\right] = 2 \damp \frac{\lambda}{\freq k}
\]</span> so that eventually the transient vibrations die out and the steady state response tracks the force with a certain lag that depends on the damping ratio for a given system and force.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.2.1" data-anchor-id="sec-xmpl:timeshift"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Input Shifted in Time</h3>
<p>Consider what the response would be if the step and the ramp forces of the discussions above were applied not at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> but they started to act at some time <span class="math inline">\(t=\tshift\)</span> as shown in <a href="#fig-shiftinput">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.8</span></a>.</p>
<p>Since the coefficients in the differential equation are time invariant, or in other words since the mass, damping and stiffness properties of the system remain unaltered as time progresses, the solution to these problems is relatively straightforward. Let us take the step input to begin with. The problem statement for zero initial conditions is given by <span class="math display">\[
m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct = \sforce \, ; \quad \left\{\gc(\tshift) = 0, \dgc(\tshift) = 0\right\} \quad \text{for } t \geq \tshift
\]</span> If we define a new time variable <span class="math inline">\(\tau = t - \tshift\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\diff q}{\diff \tau} = \frac{\diff q}{\diff t} \frac{\diff t}{\diff \tau} = \frac{\diff q}{\diff t}, \quad \frac{\diff^2 q}{\diff \tau^2} = \frac{\diff^2 q}{\diff t^2}
\]</span> so that the problem may be stated in terms of this new time variable as <span class="math display">\[
m \ddgc (\tau) + c \dgc (\tau) + k \gc (\tau) = \sforce \, ; \quad \left\{\gc(0) = 0, \dgc(0) = 0\right\} \quad \text{for } \tau \geq 0
\]</span> Note that this is exactly the same problem as that in <a href="#eq-xforcestep">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.7</span></a>, with <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> replacing <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The solution may therefore immediately be written following <a href="#eq-xsolstep">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.11</span></a> <span class="math display">\[%\begin{xequation}\label{eq:xsolstepshift}
\gc (\tau) = \frac{\sforce}{k} \left[ 1 -  \expon{-\damp \freq \tau}\left(\cos \dfreq \tau  + \frac{\damp}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \sin \dfreq \tau \right)  \right] \quad \text{for } \tau \geq 0

<p>As the methodology described above is general, the conclusion is obvious: since the coefficients of the linear equation of motion are time invariant, a time shift in input results simply results in a shift in the output. If, for example, the initial conditions for the system were nonzero at time <span class="math inline">\(t=\tshift\)</span> so that the system were to be governed by <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> then, based on equations <a href="#eq-soldsdofgen">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.6</span></a> and <a href="#eq-xsolstep">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.11</span></a> wherein we replace <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(t-\tshift\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\gcic\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dgcic\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\gc_{*}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dgc_{*}\)</span>, respectively, the response would be given by: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\gc (t) &amp; = \expon{-\damp \freq (t-\tshift)}\left[\gc_{*} \cos \dfreq (t-\tshift)  + \frac{\dgc_{*} + \damp \freq \gc_{*} }{\dfreq} \sin \dfreq (t-\tshift) \right]  + \\

\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, if an underdamped SDOF system, initially at rest, is subjected to the ramp function shown in <a href="#fig-shiftinput">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.8</span></a> so that it is governed by <span class="math display">\[

<p>There is more than one way to approach this problem, as will probably be the case in many of the problems that will be considered throughout this work. One approach is to make use of the results previously derived and construct a solution via superposition. Assume the system is underdamped and initially (at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>) at rest. The system is governed by two different equations, one corresponding to each force segment, as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct &amp; = \sforce {\ratio{t}{t_{r}}} \, ; \quad \left\{\gc(0) = 0, \dgc(0) = 0\right\} \quad \text{for } 0 \leq t &lt; t_{r} \\
   m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct &amp; = \sforce \, ; \quad \left\{\gc(t_{r}) = \gc_{*}, \dgc(t_{r}) = \dgc_{*} \right\} \quad \text{for } t \geq t_{r}
\end{align*}\]</span> The solution to the first part for <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq t &lt; t_{r}\)</span> is simple in that it is given by <a href="#eq-solforceramp">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.18</span></a> with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \sforce / t_{r}\)</span>: <span id="eq-solforcerampstep1"><span class="math display">\[
\gct = \frac{\sforce}{k \freq t_{r}} \left[\expon{-\damp \freq t}\left(2 \damp \cos \dfreq t  + \frac{2 \damp^2 - 1}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \sin \dfreq t \right) + \freq t - 2 \damp \right]
\qquad(3.20)\]</span></span> The second part is essentially a problem we have investigated in <a href="#sec-xmpl:timeshift"><span>Section&nbsp;3.2.1</span></a>, with a shifted step input and non-zero initial conditions with <span class="math inline">\(t_{r}=\tshift\)</span>. The solution was shown to be given for <span class="math inline">\(t \geq t_{r}\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\gc (t) &amp; = \expon{-\damp \freq (t-t_{r})}\left[\gc_{*} \cos \dfreq (t-t_{r})  + \frac{\dgc_{*} + \damp \freq \gc_{*} }{\dfreq} \sin \dfreq (t-t_{r}) \right]  + \\
&amp; \; \frac{\sforce}{k} \left[ 1 -  \expon{-\damp \freq (t-t_{r})}\left(\cos \dfreq (t-t_{r})  + \frac{\damp}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \sin \dfreq (t-t_{r}) \right)  \right]
\end{align*}\]</span> wherein the initial conditions <span class="math inline">\(\gc_{*}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dgc_{*}\)</span> will have to be determined as the values from the last instant governed by the solution to the first part. Substituting <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{r}\)</span> in <a href="#eq-solforcerampstep1">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.20</span></a> yields <span class="math display">\[%\begin{xequation}\label{eq:solforcerampstep1}
\gc_{*} \equiv \gc ({t_{r}}) = \frac{\sforce}{k \freq t_{r}} \left[\expon{-\damp \freq t_{r}}\left(2 \damp \cos \dfreq t_{r}  + \frac{2 \damp^2 - 1}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \sin \dfreq t_{r} \right) + \freq t_{r} - 2 \damp \right]
\]</span> The time derivative of <span class="math inline">\(\gc\)</span> may be obtained from <a href="#eq-solforcerampstep1">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.20</span></a> as <span id="eq-solforcerampstepvel"><span class="math display">\[

\]</span> Although we have obtained the full solution, the presence of damping somewhat makes the algebra complicated and the presentation symbolically overloaded; let us therefore first simplify the results by considering the undamped case with <span class="math inline">\(\damp = 0\)</span>. When there is no damping, the solution reduces to <span class="math display">\[
\gct = \begin{cases}\ratio{F}{k}\frac{1}{\freq t_{r}}\left[\freq t - \sin \freq t \right] \;  \text{for }   0 \leq t &lt; t_{r} \\
% \vspace{-1em} \\
\gc_{*} \cos \freq (t-t_{r}) + \ratio{\dgc_{*}}{\freq} \sin \freq (t-t_{r}) + \frac{F}{k}\left[ 1 - \cos \freq (t-t_{r}) \right] \;  \text{for } t \geq t_{r}
\end{cases}
\]</span> The initial conditions for the second part will be given by <span id="eq-rampstepudic"><span class="math display">\[
\gc_{*}= \ratio{\sforce}{k \freq t_{r}} \left[\freq t_{r} - \sin \freq t_{r}\right], \quad \dgc_{*}=\ratio{\sforce}{k t_{r}} \left[1 - \cos \freq t_{r} \right]
\qquad(3.22)\]</span></span> and substituting these into the solution leads, after some algebra and trigonometric combinations, to <span id="eq-solrampstepud2"><span class="math display">\[
\gct = \begin{cases} {\ratio{\sforce/k}{\freq t_{r}}}\left[\freq t - \sin \freq t \right]  &amp;  \text{for } 0 \leq t &lt; t_{r} \\

{\ratio{\sforce/k}{\freq t_{r}}} \left[ \freq t_{r} - \sin \freq t + \sin \freq (t-t_{r}) \right] &amp;  \text{for } t \geq t_{r}
\end{cases}
\qquad(3.23)\]</span></span> The response is very sensitive to the value of the rise time <span class="math inline">\(t_{r}\)</span> in relation to the system’s period <span class="math inline">\(\period\)</span> as signified by the ratio <span class="math inline">\(t_{r}/T\)</span>. Some trends may be observed better by writing the solution in terms of a normalized time <span class="math inline">\(\tau = t / \period\)</span> and replacing <span class="math inline">\(\freq\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi / \period\)</span> so that <span id="eq-solrampstepud3"><span class="math display">\[
\ratio{\gc (\tau)}{\sforce/k} = \begin{cases} {\ratio{\tau}{ (t_{r}/\period)}}- {\ratio{\sin 2 \pi \tau}{2 \pi (t_{r}/\period)}} &amp;  \text{for }   0 \leq \tau &lt; (t_{r}/\period) \\
% \vspace{-1em} \\
1 - {\ratio{\sin 2 \pi \tau - \sin 2 \pi (\tau-(t_{r}/\period))}{2\pi(t_{r}/\period)}} &amp;  \text{for }  \tau \geq (t_{r}/\period)
\end{cases}
\qquad(3.24)\]</span></span> A somewhat interesting result is observed when it is noted that whenever <span class="math inline">\((t_{r}/\period)\)</span> is some integer, <span class="math inline">\(\sin 2 \pi \tau - \sin 2 \pi (\tau-(t_{r}/\period)) = 0\)</span> since the sine of an angle is the same as the sine of the same angle plus any integer multiple of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>. In such cases, the response after the rise time becomes equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sforce/k\)</span> and no oscillations occur. Incidentally this corresponds to those cases in which the velocity of the system at the end of the ramp loading is zero. For non-integer values of <span class="math inline">\((t_{r}/\period)\)</span>, the behavior is determined by the magnitude of the ratio: if <span class="math inline">\((t_{r}/\period) \gg 1\)</span> (load is applied very slowly relative to the period of the system), the maximum response is close to <span class="math inline">\(\sforce/k\)</span>, which again could be considered as the static response of the system.

<h2 data-number="3.3" data-anchor-id="sec-harmonicforce"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Harmonic Force Excitations</h2>
<p>We have already seen that the nature of vibrations occurring in an SDOF system depend significantly on the time variation of the input relative to the period of the system. This dependence may lead to catastrophic outcomes in the case of repeated loads under which the amplifications in the response may become excessively large so as to induce failure. The most significant parameter in the response to repeated loads turns out to be the ratio of the frequency of excitation to the frequency of the system. Therefore we start the discussions of this phenomenon with the analysis of response to a single frequency input in order identify critical issues. The results developed for this case may then be used to investigate the responses to a broader set of repeated loads with the help of a well-known expansion that has been used in many branches of engineering sciences.</p>
<p>A <em>harmonic excitation</em> is essentially a single frequency sinusoidal wave. A harmonic force may be expressed as <span id="eq-harm"><span class="math display">\[
   \extforce (t) = \sforce \sinp{\extfreq t - \extphs}
\qquad(3.25)\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sforce\)</span> is the amplitude, <span class="math inline">\(\extfreq\)</span> is the <em>excitation frequency</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(\extphs\)</span> is the phase angle of the force. When analyzing long term behavior the phase generally does not have a significant bearing on design critical issues so that most often it is neglected (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\extphs\)</span> is assumed to be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>); we will however consider the possibility of a nonzero phase to promote a general discussion.</p>
<p>We will assume that such a force acts on our system for a long duration<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, long enough so that the transient vibrations have died out completely and the system is in what is called to be <em>steady state</em>. Recall that the forced vibration response of a viscously underdamped system is given by <span class="math display">\[
\gct = \gc_{c} (t) + \gc_{p}(t) = \expon{-\damp \freq t}\left(C_1 \cos \dfreq t  + C_2 \sin \dfreq t \right) + \gc_{p}(t)
\]</span> so that as <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> progresses, the exponential term tends to die out; hence the name <em>transient vibrations</em>. As the transient vibrations die out, the response is defined more and more solely by the particular solution, and this state of things is referred to as <em>steady state vibrations</em>. Since a harmonic excitation by assumption acts for a long duration, we shall initially neglect the transients and focus solely on the steady state. This does not mean that the critical response is observed always during steady state vibrations; it may be that for some cases the maximum deformation in the system occurs before the transients die out. It turns out, however, that the worst of the worst occurs for particular ranges of the excitation frequency and in those cases the transients play an insignificant role.</p>

<p>The steady state vibrations under the action of a harmonic force are governed by <span id="eq-harmsdofeom"><span class="math display">\[
    m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct = \sforce \sinp{\extfreq t - \extphs}
\qquad(3.26)\]</span></span> or equivalently, after dividing through by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, <span id="eq-harmsseom"><span class="math display">\[
    \ddgct + 2 \damp \freq \dgct + \freq^2 \gct = \frac{\sforce}{m} \sinp{\extfreq t - \extphs}
\qquad(3.27)\]</span></span> where it should be mentioned that no initial condition information is provided simply because the effects of initial conditions are irrelevant for steady state vibrations. When the forcing function is harmonic the response may be expected to be harmonic as well since, at the end of the day, the left hand side of equation ought to match the right hand side at all times, and therefore appearance of sines and cosines on the left hand side should not come as a surprise. A trial solution for steady state vibrations may therefore be formulated as <span id="eq-harmsssol_1"><span class="math display">\[
    \gct = A_1 \cosp{\extfreq t - \extphs} + A_2 \sinp{\extfreq t - \extphs}
\qquad(3.28)\]</span></span> which, when substituted into <a href="#eq-harmsseom">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.27</span></a>, leads to <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}

    -  2 \damp \freq \extfreq A_1 + \left(\freq^2 - \extfreq^2 \right) A_2 = \frac{\sforce}{m}

\]</span> and after dividing the nominators and denominators by <span class="math inline">\(\freq^4\)</span> we get <span class="math display">\[
A_1 = \ratio{\sforce}{k} \ratio{ - 2 \damp \ratfreq }{\left( 1 - \ratfreq^2 \right)^2 + \left(2 \damp  \ratfreq \right)^2}, \quad A_2 = \ratio{\sforce}{k} \ratio{ 1 - \ratfreq^2}{\left(1 - \ratfreq^2 \right)^2 + \left(2 \damp \ratfreq \right)^2}

\ratfreq = \ratio{\extfreq}{\freq}
\]</span> Since the response is given by <span class="math display">\[
\gct = A_1 \cosp{\extfreq t - \extphs} + A_2 \sinp{\extfreq t - \extphs}
\]</span> these two harmonics may, via the expansion <span class="math inline">\(\sinp{a-b} = \sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b\)</span>, be combined into a single wave, as was done on numerous previous instances, to obtain <span id="eq-harmsssol_2"><span class="math display">\[

<p>The dynamic amplification factor is a measure of increase in maximum response due to the harmonic application of the force, depending on ratio of the frequencies and available damping. How this amplification factor varies as a function of the ratio of frequencies is naturally of greatest importance, and this variation is shown graphically in <a href="#fig-harmdynamp">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.11</span></a>, along with variations of the phase angle, for various levels of viscous damping.

A massless spring represents a limiting case as the spring simply deforms in phase with the force (<span class="math inline">\(\phs = 0\)</span>), with the maximum deformation be given by <span class="math inline">\(Q = \sforce / k\)</span>.</li>
<li>For a given excitation with some finite, non-zero excitation frequency <span class="math inline">\(\extfreq\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow 0\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\freq \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, which in turn requires <span class="math inline">\(k \rightarrow \infty\)</span> for a system with finite mass.

<li><p>For all levels of damping, <span class="math inline">\(\dynamp \rightarrow 0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. This result is also obvious mathematically as the limit of the expression in <a href="#eq-harmdynamp">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.33</span></a>, and the physical system may correspond to one of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>For a given excitation with some finite, non-zero excitation frequency <span class="math inline">\(\extfreq\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow \infty\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\freq \rightarrow 0\)</span>, which in turn requires <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow \infty\)</span> for a system with finite stiffness.

\gct = - \ratio{\sforce}{m\extfreq^2} \sinp{\extfreq t - \extphs}
\]</span> The minus sign implies that the response is out of phase with the force (<span class="math inline">\(\phs \rightarrow \pi\)</span>) so that whenever the force reaches a maximum, the displacement reaches a minimum and vice versa. Clearly the maximum deformation tends to zero as <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> gets larger; in the limit, the inertia of the system is so great that no force can get it to start moving.</li>
<li>For a given excitation with some finite, non-zero excitation frequency <span class="math inline">\(\extfreq\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow \infty\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\freq \rightarrow 0\)</span>, which in turn requires <span class="math inline">\(k \rightarrow 0\)</span> for a system with finite mass.

<li>For a given system with some finite, non-zero frequency <span class="math inline">\(\freq\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow \infty\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\extfreq \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, which would mean that the time variation of the force is extremely fast and significant accelerations develop as the mass tries to respond, again allowing us neglect <span class="math inline">\(k \gct\)</span> compared to <span class="math inline">\(m \ddgct\)</span>. The governing differential equation would again effectively simplify to <span class="math inline">\(m \ddgct = \sforce \sinp{\extfreq t - \extphs}\)</span> and the response would be given by <span class="math display">\[

</ol></li>
<li><p>The dynamic amplification factor reaches a peak value somewhere in the vicinity of <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 1\)</span> when damping levels are low. We can investigate the derivative of the dynamic amplification factor with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq\)</span> to locate the extremum points: <span class="math inline">\(\diff \dynamp / \diff \ratfreq\)</span> becomes zero at <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = \sqrt{1-2 \damp^2}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\damp \leq 1/\sqrt{2}\)</span>, while for <span class="math inline">\(\damp &gt; 1 / \sqrt{2}\)</span> the derivative is zero only for <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 0\)</span>. Therefore whenever <span class="math inline">\(\damp \leq 1/\sqrt{2} \approx 71\%\)</span>, the maximum value of the dynamic amplification factor is given by <span id="eq-last"><span class="math display">\[
    \dynamp_{\max} = \dynamp \bigr|_{\ratfreq = \sqrt{1-2\damp^2}} = \ratio{1}{2 \damp} \ratio{1}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \approx \ratio{1}{2 \damp}
\qquad(3.35)\]</span></span> where the last approximation is valid for small values of the damping ratio. To provide some numerical justification, for a damping ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\damp = 10 \%\)</span>, which is not so small in terms of damping ratios frequently encountered in structural dynamics, the exact value for the amplification factor is <span class="math inline">\(5.05\)</span> whereas the approximate value is <span class="math inline">\(5.00\)</span>, with the error of approximation about <span class="math inline">\(1\%\)</span> or, in other words, practically completely negligible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the damping is zero, the amplitude of the dynamic response tends to infinity as <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = (\extfreq / \freq) \rightarrow 1\)</span>, and this phenomenon is called <span class="math inline">\(\mem{resonance}\)</span>. This infinite response is of course purely theoretical as the system would either yield or break if the deformations were to exceed critical levels but nevertheless the possibility of such large increases, no matter how small the amplitude of the forces is and purely due to the time variation of the force, is most significant. The large peaks observed in the vicinity of <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = (\extfreq / \freq) = 1\)</span> when viscous damping is present are also very significant as they may lead to excessive deformations not accounted for in design, and these will also be referred to as <em>resonance</em> to allude to the nature of phenomenon. Resonance leads to such significant increases in demands that it should definitely be avoided if possible, most probably by changing the design to modify the frequency of the system and making sure that it does not coincide with the possibly dominant frequencies of expected excitations.</p>

Note that since the system is undamped, the so-called transient solution never dies out, and in fact the maximum response may easily exceed what the particular solution, i.e.&nbsp;the dynamic amplification factor, alone predicts. The phase difference <span class="math inline">\(\phs\)</span> between the input and the output is not easily identified from these plots since the response comprises not only the particular solution but also the transients.</p>

<p>Let us see how the response develops in the presence of relatively small amount of linear viscous damping, plotted in <a href="#fig-harmonictimehistdamped">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.13</span></a>. These plots show the response of an SDOF system, with <span class="math inline">\(\damp = 1 \%\)</span>, during the first ten cycles of the input. When <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 0.1\)</span>, the transients die out by the time about 6-7 cycles of input are completed, and the steady state response starts to completely govern, with response amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\approx F/k\)</span> and phase <span class="math inline">\(\phs \approx 0\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 0.1\)</span>, the system’s (undamped) frequency is ten times bigger than the forcing frequency, and so the system’s period is about ten times smaller than the period of the input; therefore, by the time the input completes one full cycle, the transient response completes about 10 cycles, and hence we can see the transient response decaying almost completely by the end of 6-7 cycles of input. The situation is reversed when <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 3.0\)</span>, since now the system’s period is 3 times longer that the period of the input; therefore, by the time the input completes ten full cycles, the transient response completes only a bit more than 3 cycles, and hence it is still very much alive. The dominance of the steady response is therefore not obvious and the presence of two distinct frequencies is still felt at <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 10\)</span>; nevertheless, the amplitude of the response clearly indicates the decrease in the dynamic amplification factor as <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq\)</span> exceeds <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>

<p>Obviously the most interesting case is again that of near resonance, and we see that contrary to the unbounded increase observed in the undamped case, damping leads to a response converging to some finite value when <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 1\)</span>. As the transients complete about 10 cycles, the convergence is not finalized in the segment shown; in fact, for this amount of damping, the undisputed dominance of the steady state response requires about 50-60 cycles to be completed. This relatively delayed convergence is observed clearly in <a href="#fig-harmonictimehistdamped2">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.14</span></a> where the exponential decay of the response amplitude is tractable, and the response eventually converges to a steady state amplitude given by <span class="math inline">\(50 \approx 1 / (2 \damp) = 1 / 0.02\)</span> as previously discussed while the dynamic amplification factor was investigated.</p>

<p>A curious phenomenon becomes predominantly evident in the response when the excitation frequency and the frequency of the system are close in an undamped system. The response of an undamped system, initially at rest, to the external force <span class="math inline">\(\extforcet = \sforce \sinp{\extfreq t + (\pi/2)} = \sforce \cosp{\extfreq t}\)</span> was shown to be given by <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{\gct}{\sforce / k} = \dynamp \bigl[- \cos \phs \cos \freq t + \cos \phs \cos{\extfreq t}\bigr]
\]</span> When the response comprises two harmonics, it may be written, using trigonometric identities<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, as the product of two harmonic waves: one of frequency equal to the average, and the second equal to half the difference of the original two frequencies. For this particular case, it may be shown that: <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{\gct}{\sforce / k} = \dynamp \cos \phs \bigl[- \cos \freq t + \cos{\extfreq t}\bigr] = - 2 \dynamp \cos \phs \sinp{\frac{\extfreq - \freq}{2}t}\sinp{\frac{\extfreq + \freq}{2}t}
\]</span></p>
<p>This product of two sine waves is generally interpreted as one modulating wave with frequency of modulation, called the <em>beat frequency</em>, equal to <span class="math inline">\((\extfreq - \freq)\)</span>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and a second wave, of frequency equal to the average given by <span class="math inline">\((\extfreq + \freq)/2\)</span>, whose amplitude is modified in a time dependent manner by the modulating wave. The resulting pattern is shown in <a href="#fig-beatsdof">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.15</span></a> which shows the response for the case <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = \extfreq / \freq = 0.94\)</span>. If this were a sound wave, one would hear a note with a perpetually changing strength so that it would get loud and then quiet and then loud again and so on. Such a phenomenon is not very common but certainly possible in structural dynamics, with the more important considerations appearing in multi degree of freedom systems in which this beat phenomenon generally corresponds to a back-and-forth transfer of energy between different types of motion.</p>

<p>A subclass of inputs called <em>pulse type inputs</em> (or simply pulses) are useful to model excitations that are relatively of short duration. The response of an SDOF system to such inputs will be qualitatively different than those we have so far considered in that due to the short excitation duration the system will not reach steady state conditions, and most of the oscillations will be free vibrations instigated by the energy the input imparts to the system.</p>

<p>A pulse type loading often does not have a well-defined shape, such as the one shown in <a href="#fig-pulseinput">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.16</span></a>(a).

<p>How the response varies as a function of the relative pulse duration may be observed from the cases shown in <a href="#fig-responserectpulseundmpd">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.17</span></a>. In all cases, the maximum relative amplitude is capped by <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, which is the same as that observed when the system is excited by a constant force. The response may not reach this maximum though, as clearly seen in the plots corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period=0.05\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period=0.20\)</span>. The response in these cases looks very much like free vibrations with some positive initial velocity. This observation may be justified by the following argument: the well-known impulse - momentum equation, derived from Newton’s equation of motion for a particle, is given by <span class="math display">\[

<p>An important discussion directly relevant for design is the investigation of the maximum deformation that occurs during the motion of the mass.

From the plots in <a href="#fig-responserectpulseundmpd">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.17</span></a> it may be observed that whenever <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period&lt;1/2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\maxdfrm\)</span> occurs for the first time<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> during the free vibration phase (at some <span class="math inline">\(t \geq t_{d}\)</span> or, equivalently, some <span class="math inline">\(\tau \geq t_{d}/\period\)</span>) while whenever <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period \geq 1/2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\maxdfrm\)</span> occurs for the first time during the forced vibration phase (at some <span class="math inline">\(t &lt; t_{d}\)</span> or, equivalently, some <span class="math inline">\(\tau &lt; t_{d}/\period\)</span>).

This value is reached only once if <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period = 1/2\)</span> and at time <span class="math inline">\(t = t_{d} = \period/2\)</span>; it thereafter may be reached at every integer multiple of <span class="math inline">\(\period/2\)</span> if the pulse duration permits.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period &lt; 1/2\)</span>, then from <a href="#eq-resprectpulseud">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.48</span></a> for <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq t &lt; t_{d}\)</span> we see that the maximum response reached during the forced vibration stage is <span class="math display">\[

<li>The maximum vibration amplitude during the free vibrations, described by <a href="#eq-resprectpulseud">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.48</span></a> for <span class="math inline">\(t \geq t_{d}\)</span>, is given by<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[

\ratio{F}{k}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{1-\cos\left(\freq t_{d}\right)}

</ol>
<p>Based on these observations, the following may be deduced:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period \geq 1/2\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[

<li>If <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period &lt; 1/2\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[

</ol>
<p>These results therefore confirm the validity of the conclusions, deduced from a limited number of cases, for all possible values of the ratio <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}/\period\)</span>.</p>

<p>Before concluding the discussion on the rectangular pulse, we may also investigate how the principle of superposition may be employed to solve for the response. The rectangular pulse may be thought of as the combination of two step functions, one with a positive and the other with a negative amplitude with the second one also shifted in time, as schematically shown in <a href="#fig-rectpulsesp">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.19</span></a>. The response for the first part, during which only the first step function acts, is again given by <a href="#eq-solsteppulse1">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.44</span></a>. In the second part for which <span class="math inline">\(t \geq t_{d}\)</span>, both step functions act and so the response will be the superposition of the responses to each input: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\gct  &amp; = \frac{\sforce}{k} \left[ 1 -  \expon{-\damp \freq t}\left(\cos \dfreq t  + \frac{\damp}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \sin \dfreq t \right)  \right] - \\
&amp; \qquad \frac{\sforce}{k} \left[ 1 -  \expon{-\damp \freq (t-t_{d})}\left(\cos \dfreq (t-t_{d})  + \frac{\damp}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \sin \dfreq (t-t_{d}) \right)  \right] \quad \text{for } t \geq {t_d}
\end{align*}\]</span> That this expression is equivalent to the expression that would be obtained via <a href="#eq-steppulseica">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.45</span></a>, <a href="#eq-steppulseicb">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.46</span></a>, and <a href="#eq-solsteppulse2">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.47</span></a> is not obvious but it may be shown after some tedious algebra. Life is simpler if we consider the undamped case with <span class="math inline">\(\damp = 0\)</span> so that the solution obtained via superposition simplifies to <span class="math display">\[
\gct = \frac{\sforce}{k} \left[ 1 -  \cos \freq t \right]
- \frac{\sforce}{k} \left[ 1 - \cos \freq (t-t_{d}) \right]

<p>Let us now consider the response of an SDOF system to a pulse with a different shape, in particular a pulse in the form of half a sine wave as shown in <a href="#fig-pulseinput">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.16</span></a>(c).

When <span class="math inline">\(\ratdur = t_{d} / \period\)</span> is relatively small, the behavior observed for the case of a half-sine pulse is very similar to that observed for a rectangular pulse, since then the response resembles very much that of a system subjected to some initial velocity. The initial velocity depends on the impulse <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^{t_{d}} \! \extforce \dt\)</span> imparted, and it is the amount of impulse rather than the shape of the pulse that governs the response. At the other extreme, for <span class="math inline">\(\ratdur\)</span> relatively large, the effects of the pulse shape become much pronounced. Even for the case of <span class="math inline">\(\ratdur = 3\)</span> in <a href="#fig-responsesinepulseundmpd">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.20</span></a>, we can see that the mean response follows the half sine wave with amplitude fluctuations smaller than those observed for smaller <span class="math inline">\(\ratdur\)</span> values. This trend continues with increasing values of <span class="math inline">\(\ratdur\)</span> so that eventually for truly large values of <span class="math inline">\(\ratdur\)</span> the response simply tracks <span class="math inline">\(\extforcet / k\)</span> as if the system responds pseudo-statically with negligible dynamical variations. The main difference between the long duration rectangular and half-sine pulses is the sudden jump in the rectangular pulse in contrast to the comparatively slowly rising excitation in the half-sine wave, leading to dominant transients in the case of the rectangular pulse that do not die out in undamped systems.</p>

<p>Recall the prolonged analysis we presented while investigating how the maximum deformation varies depending on the duration of the rectangular pulse? The same question is also pressing in the case of the half-sine pulse. More generally, it could be the variation of maximum velocity, acceleration, or any other response related quantity that we may want to track as some function of a defining parameter. A record of the variation of some response quantity with a specific parameter when the system is subjected to a particular excitation is referred to as a <em>response spectrum</em>. The idea of a response spectrum is prominent in design because it is tailored to reflect the most critical case to be considered under a specific action. In the context of pulse-like inputs the maximum deformation is often the most relevant design parameter,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> and the variation of the maximum deformation with the duration and amplitude of the pulse excitation is referred to as a <em>shock spectrum</em>. We will see later that the concept of response spectra plays a pivotal role in aseismic design.</p>
<p>There are quite a few pulse forms that have been investigated besides the rectangular and the half-sine pulses we have analyzed in detail, with results published in many specialized publications and handbooks.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Here we just intend to introduce some samples for the concept and therefore limit our discussions to the shock spectra for the two pulse types we have analyzed in the previous sections. Consider first the case of a rectangular pulse type force which was investigated in some detail in <a href="#sec-rectangularpulse"><span>Section&nbsp;3.4.1</span></a>. In particular, it was shown that when an undamped SDOF system is acted upon by a rectangular pulse of amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\sforce\)</span> and duration <span class="math inline">\(t_d\)</span>, the maximum deformation <span class="math inline">\(\maxdfrm\)</span> that occurs in the system depends on the ratio of the pulse duration to the system’s period, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(t_d / \period\)</span>, so that</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>when <span class="math inline">\(t_d / \period \geq 1/2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\maxdfrm = 2 \ratio{\sforce}{k}\)</span>,</li>
<li>when <span class="math inline">\(t_d / \period &lt; 1/2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\maxdfrm = 2 \ratio{\sforce}{k} \abs{\sin \left( \pi \ratio{t_d}{\period}\right)}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normalizing <span class="math inline">\(\maxdfrm\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\sforce/k\)</span> would provide a measure of the amplification observed in the dynamic response compared with the static response one would observe if the same amplitude of excitation were to be applied statically. Sometimes referred to as <em>response factor</em>s, such normalized response quantities may therefore be employed as indicators for certain practices in which the maximum response amplitude is the sole critical parameter. A summary of results may be most readily shown on a simple graph depicting the variation of <span class="math inline">\(\maxdfrm / (\sforce/k)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(t_d / \period\)</span>, such as the one shown in <a href="#fig-shockspecrectpulse">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.21</span></a>.</p>

<p>A similar discussion could be held for the case of the half-sine pulse although now the algebra becomes more involved. The response of an undamped SDOF system to a half sine pulse of amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\sforce\)</span> and duration <span class="math inline">\(t_d\)</span> was shown in <a href="#sec-sinepulse"><span>Section&nbsp;3.4.2</span></a> (<a href="#eq-sinpulsesol7">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.63</span></a>) to be given by <span id="eq-sinpulsespec1"><span class="math display">\[
\ratio{\gct}{\sforce / k} = \begin{cases}
          \ratio{1}{{1-(\period/(2t_d))^2}} \Bigl[\sinp{\pi \frac{t}{t_d} } - \frac{\period}{2 t_d} \sinp{\freq t}\Bigr]   &amp; 0 \leq t &lt; t_d, , \; t_d \neq \frac{\period}{2} \\

    \end{cases}
\qquad(3.64)\]</span></span> Let us start with the case of <span class="math inline">\(t_d = T/2\)</span> as it is easier to deal with. The forced vibration phase, i.e.&nbsp;the time interval during which the force is acting, is described by <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{\gct}{\sforce / k} = \frac{1}{2} \bigl[\sinp{\freq t} - \freq t \cosp{\freq t}\bigr] = \frac{1}{2} \Bigl[\sinp{\pi\ratio{t}{t_d}} - \pi \ratio{t}{t_d} \cosp{ \pi \ratio{t}{t_d}}\Bigr]
\]</span> where we have incorporated the information that for the case at hand, <span class="math inline">\(t_d = T/2\)</span>. Extreme values occur at instances <span class="math inline">\(t^*\)</span> at which the time derivative of this expression is zero so that <span class="math display">\[
\divt{({\gct}/{(\sforce / k))}}\biggr|_{t=t^*} = \frac{1}{2} \pi^2 \ratio{t^*}{t_d^2} \sinp{\pi \ratio{t^*}{t_d}} =0
\]</span> which yields either <span class="math inline">\(t^*=0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(t^*=t_d\)</span>. It may be shown by substitution that the latter is the value that leads to the maximum response whereas the first corresponds to the instant of the minimum response. The maximum response that occurs during the forced phase is therefore given by <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{2} \Bigl[\sinp{\pi\ratio{t}{t_d}} - \pi \ratio{t}{t_d} \cosp{ \pi \ratio{t}{t_d}}\Bigr]\Biggr|_{t=t_d} = \ratio{\pi}{2}
\]</span> We can not yet conclude that this is the maximum of all response (still for the particular case of <span class="math inline">\(t_d = T/2\)</span>) since the maximum that would be observed during the free vibration phase, i.e.&nbsp;the time interval after the force stops acting, may exceed this value. The response in the free vibration phase is described by <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{\gct}{\sforce / k} = - \frac{\pi}{2} \cosp{\freq t} = - \frac{\pi}{2} \cosp{ \pi \ratio{t}{t_d}}
\]</span> which is a simple sinusoidal wave with amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\pi / 2\)</span>. We therefore may conclude that the maximum response that occurs in the system when <span class="math inline">\(t_d /T = 1/2\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\pi / 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The investigation of what happens when <span class="math inline">\(t_d /T \neq 1/2\)</span> is more involved. The response in the forced vibration phase is described by <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\ratio{\gct}{\sforce / k} &amp; =
          \frac{1}{{1-(\period/(2t_d))^2}} \Bigl[\sinp{\pi \frac{t}{t_d} } - \frac{\period}{2 t_d} \sinp{\freq t}\Bigr] \\
          &amp; = \frac{1}{{1-(\period/(2t_d))^2}} \Bigl[\sinp{\pi \frac{t}{t_d} } - \frac{\period}{2 t_d} \sinp{2 \pi \ratio{t_d}{\period} \ratio{t}{t_d}} \Bigr]
\end{align*}\]</span> To find the time instances <span class="math inline">\(t^*\)</span> at which the extreme values of this response occur, we take the derivative of the expression above and set it equal to zero at <span class="math inline">\(t=t^*\)</span> to obtain: <span class="math display">\[
\cosp{\pi \ratio{t^*}{t_d}}=\cosp{2 \pi \ratio{t^*}{\period}}
\]</span> Since cosine is an even, periodic function with a period of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>, this condition is satisfied whenever <span class="math display">\[
\pi \ratio{t^*}{t_d}= \pm 2 \pi \ratio{t^*}{\period} \pm 2 \pi n \rightarrow \ratio{t^*}{t_d} = \pm \ratio{2 n}{1 \mp (2 t_d/\period)}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a non-zero integer. To account for all possibilities is important since at this point it is almost impossible to conclude anything specific about what these values lead to in the response. It may be shown by substitution that the response attains local maximum values for the positive signs so that the values we are interested in are given by <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{t^*}{t_d} = \ratio{2 n}{1 + (2 t_d/\period)} \qquad \text{for } n=1,2,3,...
\]</span> It should also be noted that not all values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> may be used for an arbitrary value of <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period\)</span> since the viable possibilities are those for which <span class="math inline">\(t^* &lt; t_d\)</span> because we are investigating the forced vibration phase. For example, when <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period = 1\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{t^*}{t_d} = \ratio{2}{3} n &lt; 1
\]</span> which leads to a viable solution only for <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span>. For any <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>, the values obtained would not be valid since those values would lead to <span class="math inline">\(t^* &gt; t_d\)</span>, and the response expression we are investigating is not valid in that range (that would be the free vibration phase). The fact that only <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> is admissible means that there is only one local maximum (peak) in the response, a conclusion that may be verified by the corresponding plot in <a href="#fig-responsesinepulseundmpd">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.20</span></a>. This single peak occurrence persists until <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period = 1.5\)</span> since for any <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period &lt; 1.5\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{t^*}{t_d} &gt; \ratio{2 n}{4} \quad \rightarrow \quad \ratio{t^*}{t_d} &gt; 1 \qquad \text{for } n=2,3,...
\]</span> With <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period = 1.5\)</span>, the second peak starts to develop albeit with zero amplitude to begin with. When <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period = 2\)</span>, for example, <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{t^*}{t_d} = \ratio{2 n}{5} &lt; 1
\]</span> yields <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span> as viable solutions, and hence indicates the existence of two local maxima during the forced vibration phase. Similarly, the third local peak starts to kick in after <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period = 2.5\)</span>, and for <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period = 3\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{t^*}{t_d} = \ratio{2 n}{7} &lt; 1
\]</span> leading to <span class="math inline">\(n=1,2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, thereby indicating three local maxima. All of the cases above may be observed in the plots in <a href="#fig-responsesinepulseundmpd">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.20</span></a>.</p>
<p>The next issue to consider is to figure out which of these local maxima is the biggest of all. This question may be dealt with analytically but a graphical approach is somewhat easier and more informative. The local maxima in the forced vibration phase are given by the response values at times <span class="math inline">\(t=t^*\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math display">\[
\biggl(\ratio{\gc}{\sforce / k}\biggr)_{max} = \frac{1}{{1-(\period/(2t_d))^2}} \Bigl[\sinp{\pi \frac{t}{t_d} } - \frac{\period}{2 t_d} \sinp{2 \pi \ratio{t_d}{\period} \ratio{t}{t_d}} \Bigr] \biggr|_{t=t^*}
\]</span> The first local peak is defined by <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{t^*}{t_d} = \ratio{2}{1 + (2 t_d/\period)}
\]</span> so that if we want to plot how the amplitude of this local peak varies with the ratio <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period\)</span>, we have to plot the variation of <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{{1-(\period/(2t_d))^2}} \Bigl[\sinp{\pi \ratio{2}{1 + (2 t_d/\period)} } - \frac{\period}{2 t_d} \sinp{2 \pi \ratio{t_d}{\period} \ratio{2}{1 + (2 t_d/\period)}} \Bigr]
\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period \geq 0\)</span>. Similarly, for the second local peak, we have <span class="math display">\[
\ratio{t^*}{t_d} = \ratio{4}{1 + (2 t_d/\period)}
\]</span> and we plot <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{{1-(\period/(2t_d))^2}} \Bigl[\sinp{\pi \ratio{4}{1 + (2 t_d/\period)} } - \frac{\period}{2 t_d} \sinp{2 \pi \ratio{t_d}{\period} \ratio{4}{1 + (2 t_d/\period)}} \Bigr]
\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period \geq 1.5\)</span> (since the second peak does not exist for <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period &lt; 1.5\)</span>). Such plots are provided in <a href="#fig-shockspecsinepulse1">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.22</span></a> for the first three local peaks (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(n=1,2,3\)</span>).</p>

<p>The three curves in the top plot of <a href="#fig-shockspecsinepulse1">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.22</span></a> show how the amplitude of each individual peak, i.e.&nbsp;the first, the second and the third peak, that occur in the forced vibration phase varies with <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period\)</span>. Clearly the first peak’s amplitude is the largest initially but after a while the amplitude of the second peak exceeds that of the first, and after a while the peak of the third exceeds both and so on. The value corresponding to the case of <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period = 1/2\)</span> is also embedded to the first local peak plot. As we are interested in the global maximum response that will be observed during the forced vibration phase, what we need is the envelope of these curves, which is the curve shown in the bottom plot.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is whether the maximum response that will be observed in the free vibration phase exceeds the one that is observed in the forced vibration phase. The response in the free vibration phase is given by <span class="math display">\[
    \ratio{\gct}{\sforce / k} = - \frac{\period/t_d}{{1-(\period/(2t_d))^2}} \cosp{\pi \frac{t_d}{\period}} \sinp{\freq \bigl(t - \frac{t_d}{2}\bigr)}
\]</span> and so this is a simple sinusoidal wave with amplitude <span class="math display">\[
\left| \frac{\period/t_d}{{1-(\period/(2t_d))^2}} \cosp{\pi \frac{t_d}{\period}} \right|
\]</span> How this free vibration amplitude varies with <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period\)</span> is shown in the top part of <a href="#fig-shockspecsinepulse2">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.23</span></a>. The lighter line accompanying the free vibration amplitudes corresponds to the previously calculated maxima for the forced vibration phase.</p>
<p>Finally, the shock spectrum is constructed by the envelope of the two curves, i.e.&nbsp;the value of the shock spectrum at any value of <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period\)</span> is the greater of the free vibration amplitude and the maximum forced vibration response at that particular <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period\)</span>. The free vibration amplitude exceeds the maximum force vibration response for <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period &lt; 1/2\)</span> whereas the reverse is true for <span class="math inline">\(t_d/\period &gt; 1/2\)</span>. The resulting shock spectrum in terms of <span class="math inline">\({\maxdfrm}/({\sforce / k})\)</span> is shown in the lower part of <a href="#fig-shockspecsinepulse2">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.23</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The effort that goes into developing such spectra is obviously not insignificant, even for the relatively simpler case of undamped systems. What damping will do will be to decrease the amplitudes in all cases so that the undamped system may be used as a conservative estimate of what to expect. Further complexities will be introduced as the pulse shape varies. Still we find the exercise above worthwhile to introduce the concept of spectrum and illustrate the procedures engineers employ to produce such information. On the other hand, it is probably more efficient to develop such spectra using numerical methods to calculate the response to any input. Moreover, the numerical approach is the only option when analytical solutions are elusive as, for example, in the case of earthquake induced ground motions. More will be said on this issue while discussing earthquake response spectra in latter sections.</p>

<p>We have already seen that as the pulse duration tends to be very short compared to the period of the structure, the response tends to free vibrations with some initial velocity. The mathematical limit of such a pulse would be an instantaneous effect. The impulse imparted by finite amplitude pulses, however, tend to zero with decreasing duration, so in the limiting case such a pulse would have no effect whatsoever on the system. To be able to impart a finite impulse instantaneously, a generalized function called <em>Dirac-delta</em> is employed to model this limiting case.</p>
<p>The Dirac-delta function may be defined as the limit of a number of different functional forms but, for the purposes of this discussion, assume we have a rectangular pulse starting at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>, of duration <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> and amplitude <span class="math inline">\(1 / \Delta t\)</span> as shown in <a href="#fig-impulselimit">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.24</span></a>(a). The impulse imparted by this pulse is of unit magnitude, hence the limit is also referred to as the <em>unit impulse</em>. As <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t \rightarrow 0\)</span>, the amplitude increases without bound, but the integral of the function is assumed to remain at the constant value of unity, i.e.&nbsp;we assume that <span id="eq-noshow"><span class="math display">\[

<p>How would a damped SDOF system respond to such an input? Let us assume that the system is initially at rest and it is subjected to the unit impulse <span class="math inline">\(\delta (t)\)</span>. The impulse-momentum equation, with the limits of the integral corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(0^{-}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(0^{-}\)</span> is some instant very close to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, is given by <span class="math display">\[
\lsint{0^{-}}{0} \underbrace{\left[\delta(t) - c \dgct - k \gct \right]}_{\text{resultant force acting on the mass}} \dt = \sint \diff \underbrace{(m \dgct)}_{\text{momentum}} = \lsint{0^{-}}{0} m \ddgct \dt
\]</span> Let us investigate these integrals one by one. By definition, <span class="math display">\[
\lsint{0^{-}}{0} \delta(t) = 1
\]</span> and since the system is at rest, <span class="math display">\[
\sint \diff {(m \dgct)} = m \dgc (0) -  m \dgc (0^{-}) = m \dgc (0)
\]</span> The remaining two integrals need more deliberation. We have already seen while discussing response to pulse inputs that it takes some time for displacements to build up. The duration we are considering is extremely small so that the positions of the mass at <span class="math inline">\(t=0^{-}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> are practically the same, in which case the integral of <span class="math inline">\(\gc (t)\)</span> within those limits is zero. These considerations lead to <span class="math display">\[
\lsint{0^{-}}{0} c \dgct \dt = c \gc (0) - c \gc (0^{-}) = 0, \quad \lsint{0^{-}}{0} k \gct \dt = 0
\]</span> so that by the time the impulse has ended, the mass, while still at the same position, has gained a velocity equal to <span class="math display">\[
\dgc (0) = \frac{1}{m}
\]</span> A viscously damped linear SDOF system subject to a unit pulse at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> is therefore governed for <span class="math inline">\(t \geq 0\)</span> by <span id="eq-sdofimpulse"><span class="math display">\[
    m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct = 0 \, ; \quad \left\{\gc(0) = 0, \dgc(0) = \frac{1}{m} \right\}
\qquad(3.66)\]</span></span> The response to a unit impulse, i.e.&nbsp;the solution to <a href="#eq-sdofimpulse">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.66</span></a>, is very important in structural dynamics. It is often referred to as the <em>impulse response function</em> and it is designated by a special symbol for distinction.

<p>The same conclusion would be reached if we were to consider the limiting case of a finite duration rectangular pulse. The solution for a rectangular pulse, of amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\sforce\)</span> and duration <span class="math inline">\(t_{d}\)</span>, is given by <a href="#eq-solsteppulse1">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.44</span></a>, <a href="#eq-steppulseica">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.45</span></a>, <a href="#eq-steppulseicb">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.46</span></a>, and <a href="#eq-solsteppulse2">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.47</span></a>. Let us employ these solutions with <span class="math display">\[
t_{d} = \Delta t, \quad \sforce = \frac{1}{\Delta t}
\]</span> and consider the limit <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\rightarrow 0\)</span>. Using the series expansions<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> for the exponential as well as the sine and cosine terms in the solutions, the limits for the initial conditions of <a href="#eq-steppulseica">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.45</span></a> and <a href="#eq-steppulseicb">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.46</span></a> are obtained as <span class="math display">\[
\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \gc (\Delta t) = 0, \quad \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \dgc (\Delta t) = \frac{1}{m}
\]</span> so that the limit of <a href="#eq-solsteppulse2">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.47</span></a> yields <span id="eq-limitimprespd"><span class="math display">\[

<p>The linearity of the system allows for applying the principle of superposition so that if the system was subject to an impulse of amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, then the response would be simply <span class="math display">\[
\gct = \lambda \impresp (t)

\gc (t) = \lambda \impresp (t - \tshift)
\]</span> where it is implied by definition that <span class="math inline">\(\impresp (t - \tshift) = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t &lt; \tshift\)</span>.</p>

<p>If the system is subject to multiple impulses, say <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> impulses, each of which is applied at <span class="math inline">\(t = \tau_i\)</span> with amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i\)</span>, then the response of the system at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> may be evaluated via superposition as <span class="math display">\[
\gct = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i \impresp (t - \tau_i)

Consider the input sketched in <a href="#fig-inputgenimpulse">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.26</span></a>. This input may be approximated by a sequence of impulsive actions, each of which is applied at <span class="math inline">\(t = \tau_i\)</span> with impulse <span class="math inline">\(\extforce (\tau_i) \Delta \tau\)</span>. The response of the system at some time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> would be given, according to the principle of superposition, by the sum of the responses to each individual impulsive action so that <span class="math display">\[
\gct \approx \sum_{i} \left[\extforce (\tau_i) \Delta \tau \right] \impresp (t - \tau_i)

It may be considered as the general solution to all forced vibration problems regarding SDOF systems since the integral may, in theory, be evaluated given a force and the system’s impulse response function, whether analytically or by numerical means. There are, however, more accurate and efficient numerical methods used in integrating the equations of motion and the direct numerical evaluation of <a href="#eq-duhamel">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.70</span></a> is seldom used anymore.</p>
<p>Two further points should be made in passing. First, it should be apparent if we follow the development of the formulations that the solution in <a href="#eq-duhamel">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.70</span></a> is constructed for a system initially at rest. If the system has non-zero initial conditions so that <span class="math inline">\(\gc (0) = \gcic\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dgc (0) = \dgcic\)</span>, their contribution may be included via superposition as <span id="eq-duhamelic"><span class="math display">\[
    \gct =  \expon{-\damp \freq t}\left[\gcic \cos \dfreq t  + \frac{\dgcic + \damp \freq \gcic }{\dfreq} \sin \dfreq t \right] + \lsint{0}{t} \extforce (\tau) \impresp (t-\tau) \diff \tau
\qquad(3.71)\]</span></span> The second point is related to how the convolution may be executed in terms of what is referred to as its commutativity. By defining a new (dummy) variable <span class="math inline">\({\tau}^{*} = t - \tau\)</span> so that<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(\diff {\tau}^{*} = - \diff \tau\)</span>, <a href="#eq-duhamel">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.70</span></a> may be expressed as <span id="eq-duhamel3"><span class="math display">\[

Whether the form in <a href="#eq-duhamel">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.70</span></a> or the one in <a href="#eq-duhamel3">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.72</span></a> should be preferred is solely a matter of pragmatism in that one form may lead to integrals that are simpler to evaluate; otherwise, these two forms are equivalent and either may be employed in any problem.</p>

<p>Next, we consider two interrelated problems dealing with systems subjected to harmonic excitations. The first question we will ask is, how does the magnitude of the force transmitted to the base of a SDOF system depend on the excitation frequency? In other words, are there particular strategies that can isolate the force transmitted to the base? This problem is of course relevant for designing a foundation or support structure may have to sustain the dynamic loads induced by a machine housed in the building. More commonly, there may be stringent limits to the magnitude of forces transmitted to the base in applications where they may be other sensitive equipment housed nearby. The second related problem pertains to base excitation described in the previous section. The central question here is are there strategies that can be implemented to limit, as much as possible, forces transmitted from the ground motion to the structure, given a certain ground excitation (either accelerations or displacements) with a sinusoidal time history and constant amplitude. An obvious application here is base isolation of structure to protect it from earthquake induced ground excitations, but there are other applications for this as well. For instance, in laboratories housing sensitive equipment such as microscopes, base isolation is necessary to ensure that pedestrian motion nearby does not impact instrument performance.</p>
<p>We start our inquiry by examining first the problem of force transmission to the base by a mass subject to simple harmonic motion. First, it will be necessary to rewrite our equation of motion and isolate the elements that transmit forces to the base. The total force <span class="math inline">\(\extforce_{tr} (t)\)</span> transmitted to the base comprises forces coming from springs and dampers, and it may be expressed as:<br>
<span class="math display">\[\extforce_{tr} (t)= k \gct + c \dgct \]</span></p>
<p>For an excitation <span class="math inline">\(\extforce (t) = \sforce \cosp{\extfreq t}\)</span>, the solution to the equation of motion gives us <span class="math display">\[\gct = \dynamp \frac{\sforce }{k} \cosp{\extfreq t - \phs} \]</span> and <span class="math display">\[ \dgct = - \dynamp \frac{\sforce }{k} \sinp{\extfreq t - \phs} \]</span> so that plugging <span class="math inline">\(\gct\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dgct\)</span> into the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\extforce_{tr} (t)\)</span> yields: <span class="math display">\[ \extforce_{tr} (t) = \dynamp \frac{\sforce }{k} \left[ k \cosp{\extfreq t - \phs} + c \extfreq  \sinp{\extfreq t - \phs} \right] = \sforce_{tr} \cosp{\extfreq t - \phs_{tr}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\phs_{tr}\)</span> is the phase difference between the applied external force and the force transmitted to the base, and <span class="math inline">\(\sforce_{tr}\)</span> is the amplitude of the transmitted force given by <span class="math display">\[ \sforce_{tr}  = \dynamp \frac{\sforce }{k} \sqrt{k^2 + c^2 \extfreq^2} \]</span></p>
<p>If the problem were static, the force transmitted would be equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sforce\)</span>. Amplification factor for transmissibility in the dynamic case can be given as: <span class="math display">\[ \frac{\sforce_{tr} }{\sforce} = \dynamp \sqrt{1 + \frac{c^2}{k^2} \extfreq^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Noting that <span class="math inline">\(c^2 = (2 m \freq \damp)^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k^2 = (m \freq^2)^2\)</span>, the expression above may be written as <span class="math display">\[\frac{\sforce_{tr} }{\sforce} = \dynamp \sqrt{1 + \left(2\damp \frac{\extfreq}{\freq}\right)^2}\]</span> and substituting in <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = \frac{\extfreq}{\freq}\)</span> and the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\dynamp(\ratfreq)\)</span> given by <a href="#eq-harmdynamp">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.33</span></a>, we get: <span id="eq-FT"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\sforce_{tr}}{\sforce} = \sqrt{\ratio{1+(2\damp \ratfreq)^2}{\left(1 - \ratfreq^2 \right)^2 + \left(2 \damp \ratfreq \right)^2}}

<p>This ratio describing the amplification in force transmission due to dynamic effects is called <em>transmissibility</em> in the context of structural dynamics and it is an important consideration for numerous applications including vehicle, structure, and instrument design. <a href="#fig-transmissibility">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.27</span></a> shows how the transmissibility changes as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\damp\)</span>. It is noteworthy that for very stiff systems, i.e.&nbsp;as <span class="math inline">\(k \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\sforce_{tr}}/{\sforce} \approx 1\)</span>. Additionally, if <span class="math inline">\({\sforce_{tr}}/{\sforce} &lt; 1\)</span> is desired, then in lightly damped systems we would like to have <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq &gt; \sqrt{2}\)</span>, which corresponds to systems with low stiffness values. Finally, near the resonant frequency for <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \approx 1\)</span>, damping plays an important positive role and can substantially reduce transmissibility.</p>

<p>There are many instances in which it may be desirable to induce vibrations to a structure or device with a prescribed frequency and amplitude. This is used in structural models for instance for health monitoring and dynamical testing. Other applications include eccentric mass vibration motors that are commonly used as haptic feedback devices (e.g.&nbsp;vibrations of a cell phone or game controller). <a href="#fig-eccmassvib">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.28</span></a> illustrates an example structure on which such a device is mounted. In this scenario, we assume that the columns and beam are axially rigid, and only lateral forces induced by the rotation of the mass generate forces that translate into motion, with the lateral displacement <span class="math inline">\(\gc (t)\)</span> of the portal frame being the only degree of freedom.</p>
<div id="fig-eccmassvib" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>In this case, the eccentrically rotating mass <span class="math inline">\(m_r\)</span> rotates around the anchor point with constant angular velocity <span class="math inline">\(\extfreq\)</span>, and its eccentricity, i.e.&nbsp;its offset from the anchor point, is <span class="math inline">\(e_m\)</span>. This eccentrically rotating mass is referred to as the <em>unbalanced mass</em> in some applications. The total non-rotating mass, comprising the structural mass and, if relatively significant, the mass of the motor, is <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. The system has a total lateral stiffness <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and it is viscously damped with damping coefficient <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. The rotation of the eccentric mass generates a tensile force on the bar as the bar tries to keep the rotating mass on its circular path. This force gets transmitted to the beam, and consequently a dynamic lateral force is exerted by the motor on the structure which can be expressed as: <span class="math display">\[ \extforce(t) = m_r e_m \extfreq^2 \cosp{\extfreq t}\]</span></p>
<p>It is worth noting here that the amplitude of the force depends on the angular velocity of the rotating mass, which is also the frequency of the excitation. The equation of motion for the system is then given as: <span class="math display">\[  m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct = m_r e_m  \extfreq^2 \cosp{\extfreq t} \]</span> or equivalently, <span class="math display">\[  \ddgct + 2 \damp \freq \dgct + \freq^2 \gct = \frac{m_r e_m \extfreq^2}{m} \cosp{\extfreq t - \phs} \]</span></p>
<p>Considering only the steady state response, the displacement response of the system is given by <span class="math display">\[\gct = Q \cosp{\extfreq t - \phs}\]</span> where the dynamic amplitude <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and the phase angle <span class="math inline">\(\phs\)</span> are given by <span id="eq-meR"><span class="math display">\[
Q = \ratio {m_r e_m }{m} \ratio{\ratfreq^2}{\sqrt{\left(1 - \ratfreq^2 \right)^2 + \left(2 \damp \ratfreq \right)^2}} = \ratio {m_r e_m}{m} \ratfreq^2 \dynamp

\tan {\phs} =  \ratio{2\damp \ratfreq}{1-\ratfreq^2}
\qquad(3.75)\]</span></span></p>
<p><a href="#fig-harmdynampem">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.29</span></a> shows the variation of the response amplitude (normalized by <span class="math inline">\(m_r e_m / m\)</span>) with the ratio of the excitation frequency to the frequency of the system. As should be expected, this graph is quite similar to the response graphs we have previously encountered for harmonic inputs. In the limit of vanishing angular velocity of the motor as <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow 0\)</span> or very high values of system frequency as <span class="math inline">\(\freq \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, the displacement response diminishes to zero since the either the magnitude of the applied force becomes negligible or the structure is very rigid. As the angular speed of the motor increases so that <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, the dynamic response converges to <span class="math inline">\(Q = {m_r e_m}/{m}\)</span>. Damping is inconsequential near these limits, but again plays a critical role in reducing the response amplitude near the resonant frequency <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \approx 1\)</span>, with the resonant condition occurring at <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq&gt;1\)</span> (but still close to 1) for damped systems.</p>

<p>Consider what would happen if you were to stand on a cart, and someone started to shake the cart back and forth. You whole body would, if there was sufficient friction between your shoes and the surface of cart, eventually move with the cart, sometimes in and sometimes opposite to the direction in which the cart moves, and you would possibly topple over should the cart move too quickly. This is one way to feel what happens in earthquakes, of which more will be said further down the road. During an earthquake, the ground on which the structure stands moves due to waves travelling in and on the surface of the earth, forcing the supports, i.e.&nbsp;the points at which the structure is connected to the ground, to move with it.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> This motion is in turn transmitted to the whole structure, whereby so many unfortunate losses have occurred in past earthquakes.

</div>
<p>To better visualize some concepts and direct the focus of our investigations to how building-like structures behave during earthquakes, we will work with a modified (but completely analogous) SDOF prototype: the 2D, single bay single story frame shown in <a href="#fig-sdofbase">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.30</span></a>(a), with mass concentrated at the floor level. The whole story has a certain lateral stiffness, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the value of which will depend on the material, dimensions and end conditions of load bearing elements such as columns and beams. The vertical elements in the load bearing system are graphically represented by the two columns. All elements are assumed to have sufficient axial rigidity so that their axial deformations may be neglected compared to bending deformations; therefore two ends of a line element are assumed to translate by the same amount along the longitudinal axis of that element. With this assumption, the only translation possible is the common lateral translation of the top joints. Rotations of the joints are assumed to have either negligibly small accelerations and/or negligibly small masses associated with these accelerations so that no significant inertia is developed in rotational degrees of freedom, and therefore these are not considered explicitly as dynamic degrees of freedom.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Furthermore, although mass is present in vertical as well as horizontal members, it is generally the case that the concentration of inertial effects in the vicinity of the floor level is significantly larger than those contributed by the vertical members, so that the mass of the system may be assumed to be concentrated at the floor level. This mass, generally referred to as the floor mass, is graphically indicated by the block of mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> located at the top of the frame. With these assumptions, the model is an SDOF system, with lateral translation of the floor mass as its sole degree of freedom.</p>
<p>When the ground moves horizontally as <span class="math inline">\(\gdist\)</span>, the mass would move by the same amount if there were no deformations of the columns, but this is not possible because of the inertia effects. In general the mass moves relative to the ground by an amount of <span class="math inline">\(\gct\)</span> so that at some instant <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the mass has moved from its original (stationary) equilibrium position by <span class="math display">\[
\adis (t) = \gct + \gdist
\]</span> To address the two movements distinctly, <span class="math inline">\(\adis (t)\)</span> is referred to as the <em>absolute displacement</em> or <em>total displacement</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(\gct\)</span> is referred to as the <em>relative displacement</em> of the mass; the relative displacement is referred to more simply as the <em>deformation</em> since its value at any instant corresponds to the amount of deformation in the spring (the columns in this case) at that instant. The forces, including the d’Alembert force, that act on the mass at instant <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are shown in <a href="#fig-sdofbase">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.30</span></a>(b). The important thing to note is that the d’Alembert force depends on the absolute motion of the mass, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\aacc (t)\)</span>, since Newton’s law demands that acceleration be measured relative to a stationary reference (and the base the structure is attached to is not stationary in this case), but the forces that develop due to the deformation of the columns, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(k \gc\)</span>, and those that develop in proportion to the rate of deformation across the damper, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(c \dgc\)</span>, depend on the relative motion of the mass with respect to the ground (the base the structure is attached to). Summation of forces leads to <span id="eq-sdofbaseeom1"><span class="math display">\[
m \aacc (t) + c \dgct + k \gct = 0
\qquad(3.76)\]</span></span> which is a correct equation of motion but not directly applicable since generally we aim to investigate the resulting motion of the mass under a specific ground motion. The ground motion may be treated as a known external excitation in two different ways. We may choose to track the absolute motion of the mass, in which case we may substitute <span class="math inline">\(\gct = \adis (t) - \gdist\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dgct = \avel (t) - \gvelt\)</span> into <a href="#eq-sdofbaseeom1">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.76</span></a> ,and move the terms related to the ground motion to the right hand side of the equation to obtain: <span id="eq-sdofbaseeom2"><span class="math display">\[
m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct = c \gvelt + k \gdist
\qquad(3.77)\]</span></span> If, on the other hand, we choose to track the relative motion of the mass, we substitute <span class="math inline">\(\aacc (t) = \ddgct + \gacct\)</span> into <a href="#eq-sdofbaseeom1">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.76</span></a>, and move the ground acceleration term to the right hand side of the equation to obtain: <span id="eq-sdofbaseeom3"><span class="math display">\[
m \ddgct + c \dgct + k \gct = - m \gacct
\qquad(3.78)\]</span></span> Which of these equations is to be preferred generally depends on the particular details of a specific problem, but admittedly <a href="#eq-sdofbaseeom3">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.78</span></a> is by far the more commonly encountered one, especially for SDOF systems. The relative displacement is most readily related to the shear forces that must be transmitted by the columns and the maximum relative displacement therefore is an important design parameter which can be addressed more directly via <a href="#eq-sdofbaseeom3">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.78</span></a>. Furthermore, this equation is quite similar in form to that of an SDOF system subject to an external force, and in earthquake response analysis the term on the right hand side, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(-m \gacct\)</span>, is often referred to as the <em>effective earthquake force</em>. The form of the governing equation may be abridged if we divide both sides by the mass, after which we obtain <span id="eq-sdofbaseeomf"><span class="math display">\[
\ddgct + 2 \damp \freq \dgct + \freq^2 \gct = - \gacct
\qquad(3.79)\]</span></span> This form of the equation of motion more emphatically demonstrates that the response of a system to a specific base motion depends solely on two parameters: the frequency and the damping ratio of the system.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> To highlight the significance of this observation, let us investigate the following scenario: consider two single degree of freedom systems, one extremely heavy and stiff, the other extremely light and flexible, such that they have the same frequency and damping ratio. Identical displacements (and hence velocities and accelerations) will develop in these two systems when they are both subjected to the same ground motion, no matter what the ground motion looks like, albeit the two systems seemingly being very different.</p>
<p>Often the critical issue with base excitations in the context of structural dynamics is calculation of demands induced on structures by earthquake induced ground motions. Such motions are quite erratic with time histories defying analytical expressions, and we therefore feel that the details of earthquake response analysis are best left after a discussion of numerical methods to be used in solving the equation of motion. There is, however, significant insight to be gained from analyses of simpler loading patterns, and this is what we undertake for the rest of this section.</p>

We had previously seen in <a href="#sec-pulseimpulse"><span>Section&nbsp;3.4</span></a> that the effects of a pulse-type force tend to be more pronounced when the pulse duration exceeds half the period of the system. In the case of a base excitation, this phenomenon seems to be somewhat reversed: It seems that the amplitude of the maximum relative displacement approaches the amplitude of the ground displacement when the pulse duration tends be much shorter compared to the period of the system, and that when the duration exceeds the period by a significant amount, the amplitude of the relative displacement tends to zero. It may be argued that such an observation is consistent with how the excitation is transmitted to the mass via the stiffness elements. For a finite duration pulse, <span class="math inline">\(\ratdur \rightarrow 0\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\period \rightarrow \infty\)</span> and so, for a finite mass, <span class="math inline">\(k \rightarrow 0\)</span>: in this case the ground moves but exceedingly small forces develop in the stiffness elements, therefore negligibly little force is transferred to the mass and so the mass remains almost still (with respect to the stationary frame of reference), thereby the maximum relative displacement of the mass with respect to the (moving) ground approaches the amplitude of the ground motion. At the other extreme, <span class="math inline">\(\ratdur \rightarrow \infty\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\period \rightarrow 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, in which case the deformations in the stiffness elements remain negligibly small (even though now the forces may be very large), and so the mass moves in almost full accordance with the ground and the relative displacement approaches zero (although the mass moves with respect to the stationary frame of reference). These two extremes are common characteristics in all systems subjected to base motion.</p>

<p>What would happen if there was damping in the system? The various cases hitherto discussed have demonstrated that the undamped case provides an upper bound on the response amplitudes, and that when damping is present the response amplitudes decrease. The same is true in this case, with the maximum response decreasing as the damping ratio increases, and the response exponentially decaying in free vibrations. To provide some quantitative results, the responses of three SDOF systems with different values of viscous damping ratios are shown in <a href="#fig-pulseGMdmpd">Figure&nbsp;<span>3.33</span></a>, where the rate of decay in time and decrease in maximum response are seen to be highly dependent on the available damping.</p>

<p>Resonance is possible also in the case of base excitations and its effects are highly devastating on structures. Although similar to the case of harmonic forces, there are some differences that should be highlighted when the input is that of ground motion.

<li>For all levels of damping, <span class="math inline">\(\dynamp \rightarrow 0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. This result is also obvious mathematically as the limit of the relationship in <a href="#eq-harmGMU">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.101</span></a>, and may physically be interpreted as the case of a system with a finite mass and almost no lateral stiffness so that <span class="math inline">\(\freq \rightarrow 0\)</span>. As the ground moves, the lateral force that develops in the lateral stiffness system remains negligibly small so that the accelerations that the mass develops remain negligible. The mass therefore practically stands still with respect to a stationary frame of reference while the ground moves, with the steady state relative displacement of the mass with respect to the ground therefore given by <span class="math inline">\(\gct \approx - \gdist\)</span>.</li>
<li>The ratio <span class="math inline">\(Q / \maxgdis = \ratfreq^2 \dynamp\)</span> reaches a peak value somewhere in the vicinity of <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 1\)</span> when damping levels are low. Taking the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq^2 \dynamp\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq\)</span> to locate the extremum points yields the following possibilities: if <span class="math inline">\(\damp \leq 1/\sqrt{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\dif (\ratfreq^2 \dynamp )/ \diff \ratfreq\)</span> becomes zero at <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 1/\sqrt{1-2 \damp^2}\)</span>, while for <span class="math inline">\(\damp &gt; 1 / \sqrt{2}\)</span> the derivative is zero only for <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq = 0\)</span>. Therefore whenever <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \leq 1/\sqrt{2} \approx 71\%\)</span>, the maximum amplification is given by <span id="eq-amp"><span class="math display">\[
    \left( \ratio{Q}{\maxgdis}\right)_{\max} = (\ratfreq^2\dynamp)\biggr|_{\ratfreq=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2\damp^2}}} = \ratio{1}{2 \damp} \ratio{1}{\sqrt{1-\damp^2}} \approx \ratio{1}{2 \damp}

It was already shown in <a href="#sec-harmonicforce"><span>Section&nbsp;3.3</span></a> that even for a relatively sizeable damping ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\damp = 10 \%\)</span>, the error of approximation remained about <span class="math inline">\(1\%\)</span>. As in the case of harmonic force excitations, the amplitude of the dynamic response tends to infinity as <span class="math inline">\(\ratfreq \rightarrow 1\)</span> for undamped systems, representing the theoretical upper bound although in practice it is impossible for deformations to reach even finitely large levels. Structures inevitably have energy dissipation through many mechanisms and inelastic deformations would alter system characteristics in any case after certain thresholds of deformation are exceeded.</li>

<p>The model we have so far discussed while investigating vibrations due to ground motion is the most basic model and while it is extremely useful in understanding the fundamental concepts and patterns, it contains some simplifying assumptions that should be highlighted.</p>
<p>One point to make is that this model presumes a rigid ground such that the behavior of the soil and the structure may be assumed to be completely uncoupled. Soil is a deformable medium that has its own dynamic characteristics which are amplitude and frequency dependent. Any excitation transmitted via the soil is transmitted by waves that travel in the soil, and one part of the problem is the apparent wavelength of these soil waves in comparison with the dimensions of the structure. For relatively short spans all the supports of the structure may be assumed to move identically, whereas for long span structures it is possible to have significant differences in support motions. The second issue is the disturbance or modification that will take place in such wave motion due to the presence of the structure. If the structure is very flexible compared to the soil, the disturbance generated by its presence is generally expected to be relatively small so that the ground motion measured away from the structure, called the <em>free-field motion</em>, is roughly the same as that which would be measured at the base of the structure. On the other hand, the presence of a relatively rigid structure on flexible soil is expected to locally modify the ground motion significantly, leading to significant differences is free-field measurements and the actual motion at the structure’s base. This issue may be very significant when one wishes to analyze the effects of a specific earthquake on a structure based on measured free-field ground motions as actual base motions may not be available.</p>
<p>A related point is that rotational motion (in this case, rotation in the plane of the 2D model) is neglected. Free field ground motions rarely contain significant surface rotations but in some cases, for example in the existence of a large rigid foundation plate, pronounced soil structure interaction may lead to rotational motion. Such rotations lead to additional lateral motion and inertia, leading to increased demands in the load bearing members, while also increasing contributions from gravity loads which may in turn reduce effective lateral stiffness. There are simple models that help in understanding and quantifying such effects and some will be introduced further on.</p>
<p>Possibly the most important issue is the omission of inelastic response. Earthquakes, at least those that are deemed significant, exert large demands on structures such that elastic behavior limits are almost always exceeded. In such cases, the linear elastic model of <a href="#eq-sdofbaseeomf">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.79</span></a> is generally modified to <span id="eq-nlsdofbaseeomf"><span class="math display">\[
\ddgct + 2 \damp \freq \dgct + \stifforce (\gc) = - \gacct
\qquad(3.104)\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(\stifforce (\gc)\)</span> is the lateral force provided by the stiffness members on the mass and it is now a non-linear function of the deformation <span class="math inline">\(\gc (t)\)</span>. This issue will be revisited in greater detail while discussing earthquake induced vibrations in latter sections.</p>
